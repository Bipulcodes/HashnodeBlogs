**git config command:**

With Git, there are many configurations and settings possible. *git config* is how to assign these settings. Two important settings are user ***user.name*** and ***user***[***.email***](http://user.email). These values set what email address and name commits will be from on a local computer. With *git config*, a ***\--global* flag** is used to write the settings to all repositories on a computer. Without a ***\--global* flag** settings will only apply to the current repository that you are currently in.
