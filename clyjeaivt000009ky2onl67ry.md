### *SAP* :

This three letter word SAP you can usually found in **Job offers,** **Discussions** ,**Newspapers** or over the **Internet .** Though its appeared in different context in different place you may usually get it in newspaper as a High paid Skill anyway let's come to the point.

SAP is a BIG COMPANY that produces Big Softwares for managing companies mostly Big companies or even small companies if they use it probably are going to develop fast.  
SAP is a german company full form is **Systeme, Anwendungen und Produkte or in English Systems, Applications and Products** both of the word is it not sounding weird ? but who care it is better for writing in notebook ðŸ˜‚ I can guarantee that many SAP specialist should think a little bit to remember the full name of it. Same Like a BMW owner many people own it but does not know what is the full name but who care is that mean than can't drive the car 'course a BIG NO!!!!!!!!

As I said that SAP company produces Big software you may ask which kind of big software they usually produce? They produce ERP software . ERP software is nothing but a **Enterprise Resource Planning** Software. Here Resource could be anything like it could be Finance, Product Planning , Human Resource, sales and Distribution etc etc. There are other companies they also produce ERP but why we are talking about SAP because they are good and easy to use. Something like Microsoft they are the Good about Operating system is that means there are no other Operating System in the market?

Full name of the company that is situated in germany is SAP SE and the popular product of this is SAP ERP(Type of software to maintain customer relation and business operation), this is not the only product of this company there are other product as well like SAP CRM, SAP PLM, SAP BI etc. Do you think its sounding complicated ?  
For example There is COCA-COLA a company which sell Coca-Cola drink. So if someone says My brother works for coca-cola that means he work at coca-cola office but if someone says my son like to drink coca-cola that means he likes the product of coca-cola.
