Every beginner in coding might install vs-code because this editor provides some sort of shortcut, but somehow it uses the power of other software let me tell you why.

If you don't know about a [website](https://emmet.io/) just google it or click on [it](https://emmet.io/) and then the magic begins here.

For example when you are building a website then you required some unnecessary text to fill the website or to test the website by using this you can achieve this. Just go to vs code and write lorem5 or lorem(type the number of words you want) and hit tab key and boom!

You will get the number of words and no need to google for paragraphs to test your website.
