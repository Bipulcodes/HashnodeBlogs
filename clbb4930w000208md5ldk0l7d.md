# Do you know how to do display in  HTML like this below ?

If someone asks you hey can you display <mark>" &gt; "</mark> <mark>" &amp; " </mark> " <mark>" </mark> " ? I am damn sure that you don't know about this or never thought about these things.

This is called <mark>Entity</mark>. The browser is a very unsmart object this is our duty to educate him because Browser will take this thing as tags only that's why we have say in this specific way:

<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>&amp;</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><code>&amp;amp;</code></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Interpreted as the beginning of an entity or character reference.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>&lt;</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><code>&amp;lt;</code></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Interpreted as the Starting location of a tag</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>&gt;</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><code>&amp;gt;</code></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Interpreted as the ending of a tag</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>"</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><code>&amp;quot;</code></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Interpreted as the beginning and end of an attribute's value.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
